#Creates a point at the given real
#coordinates
FUNCTION: Point( Real , Real )

#Creates a line segment that is a straight
#line drawn from the first point to the 
#second point
FUNCTION: LineSegment( Point , Point )

#Creates an infinite, straight line
#that is extended from the lines
#segment created by the two points
FUNCTION: Line( LineSegment )

#Creates a circle centered
#at a given point and with
#the given decimal radius
FUNCTION: Circle( Point , Real )

#Creates an angle with the
#given number of degrees
FUNCTION: Angle( Real )

#Determines if two angles are equal
RELATION: AngleEquals( Angle , Angle )

#All right angles are equal to
#one another, so we will use a constant
#object to represent this
OBJECT: RightAngle 	, Angle
