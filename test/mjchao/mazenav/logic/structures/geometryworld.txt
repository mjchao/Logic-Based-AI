#Creates a point at the given real
#coordinates
FUNCTION: Point

#Creates a line segment that is a straight
#line drawn from the first point to the 
#second point
FUNCTION: LineSegment

#Creates an infinite, straight line
#that is extended from the lines
#segment created by the two points
FUNCTION: Line

#Creates a circle centered
#at a given point and with
#the given decimal radius
FUNCTION: Circle

#Creates an angle with the
#given number of degrees
FUNCTION: Angle

#Determines if two angles are equal
FUNCTION: AngleEquals

#All right angles are equal to
#one another, so we will use a constant
#object to represent this
CONSTANT: RightAngle
